# Coding Standards

### C++ Version:
Please ensure that you use **C++17** throughout your contributions to this project. With regards to IDE preference, for development our team will use Eclipse 2020-12 as it is currently the most stable for development.

***

### Header Files:
In general, every .cc file should have an associated .h file. There are some common exceptions, such as unit tests and small .cc files containing just a main() function.
Correct use of header files can make a huge difference to the readability, size and performance the code.

#### #Define Guards
Within all header files ensure the use of #Define guards to prevent multiple inclusives and to avoid unneceassary code recursion. Conflicts or recursive errors could result in code failing to build.
